### This Repo Has Mini Projects In Python

#### 1. [Password generator](https://github.com/iamrahulreddy/MINI_Projects/blob/main/password_generator.py).
        This program can be improved but it mostly statisfies currently used industry standard practices for passwords.
        We should import random module
        We then use sample function for sampling,and then we join it with the sampled characters,numbers,special characters. 
 
 ### 2.[Guessing game using python](https://github.com/iamrahulreddy/MINI_Projects/blob/main/GuessingGameUsingPython.py).
        This program is fun one actually.. Wasted a lot of time playing with it:)
        Anyway we need to import random module for this to work.
       
  ### 3.[Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/iamrahulreddy/MINI_Projects/blob/main/RockPaperScissors.py).
        This is more or less similar to above game.
        
  ### 4.[Phone number info](https://github.com/iamrahulreddy/MINI_Projects/blob/main/phonenumber_info.py).
        This Is Very A Interesting program That Gives Your Phone Number Info Like Region,Telecom Operator etc.. 
        You should provide your phone number as input for this to work
